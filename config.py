# Current portfolio assumption: 
# 1) Only buy and hold one share of SPY at market open on the first day
# 2) Enter a collar using 0DTE, and let it expire at market close. 
# 3) The costs of entering a collar strategy are negligible, as most of them are negative
# 4) ETF dividends were not included in calculation
# 5) No fund distribution/payout to fund investors
# 6) Overnight cost changes are not hedged
